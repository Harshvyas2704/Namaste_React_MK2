react -> core react things
react-dom -> we need this to modify dom



common code notes

    const heading = React.createElement("h1", {*}, "Hello world, from ReactJs!");
        this will create an element
        this will give us Object not h1 tag

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        this will create a room which is must to render anything

    root.render(heading);
        this will append heading into root element
        this will take heading object, convert it into h1 tag and put it on DOM

    *this empty object we use to give attribute
