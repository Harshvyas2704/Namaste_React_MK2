NPM -> is the standard repository for all the packages.
package.json is configuration for packages or dependancies.
Bundlers -> this will bundle our app and packages together so we can ship our app to production.

npm install -D parcel
    What is -D?
        1) Dev dependancies
            - this generally required this development phase.
        2) Normal dependancies
            - may use in productions.

if we use ^ in version then parcel will automatically upgrade to newer version. for minor version. (safe)
if we use ~ in version then parcel will automatically upgrade to newer version. for major version.

package.json might upgrade the version (minor) but package-lock.json will lock the version and keeps record of the version so it will not have ^ or ~. it have exact version. Always put these 2 files in git repo. this have records of all the required dependancies. so we can regenerate node modules from this files.

if we delete node modules then we can regenerate all of that with this command (npm install)

note: whatever you can regenerate do not put it on git repository

Transetive Dependancies: - we have install parcel then parcel have its own dependancies that dependancies have its own dependancies so this things called Transetive Dependancies.

make our src file type as module
